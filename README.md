# CardManagement

## Description
A simple CRUD application for managing cards, consisting of two separate parts: a frontend and a backend that communicate with each other via API. The frontend is written in Vue.js, while the backend uses PHP with the Laravel framework. The application integrates with a MySQL database, ensuring efficient handling of card data.
